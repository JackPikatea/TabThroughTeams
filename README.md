# TabThroughTeams
While in a Microsoft Teams meeting, the Tab key does not go through when controlling another users screen. This AHK script fixes this issue by replacing the tab keypress with a combination of other keys that actually work.

The source (.ahk) is provided as well as a compiled version. It works by holding alt and then pressing numpad 0 and numpad 9 and then releasing alt. This script only works while Teams.exe is running and replaces the Tab key. I would recommend placing it in your startup folder so you never have to think about it again.
